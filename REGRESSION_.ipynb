        "  Polynomial regression in Python is implemented using libraries like scikit-learn. The common steps begin with importing PolynomialFeatures from sklearn.preprocessing. This is used to transform the input variable X into polynomial terms of desired degree.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  Next, LinearRegression is applied to these transformed features. A typical code structure looks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n",
        "    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
        "\n",
        "    poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)\n",
        "    X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\n",

        "    model = LinearRegression()\n",
        "    model.fit(X_poly, y)\n",

        "After fitting, predictions are made using:\n",
        "\n",
        "    y_pred = model.predict(X_poly)\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualization can be done using matplotlib to plot the curve against actual data.\n",
        "Thus, polynomial regression is simple to implement and widely used in data science.\n"
